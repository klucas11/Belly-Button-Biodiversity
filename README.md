# Belly Button Biodiversity
This project was my first foray into building an interactive dashboard and deploying to Heroku. It uses a Flask app to pull from a database and create charts based on a userâ€™s selection from a dropdown menu on the dashboard. This dataset (from [The Public Science Lab](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/)) explores the biodiversity inhabiting the human belly button. 

### Technologies Used
* Pandas
* Numpy
* sqlalchemy
* flask
* flask_sqlalchemy
* Plotly.js

### [View The Dashboard On Heroku](https://belly-button-biodiversity-kl.herokuapp.com/)

### Dashboard Interactions
* Use the dropdown to select a sample
* Charts will be generated based on the selection
