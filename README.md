# Belly Button Biodiversity
This project was my first foray into building an interactive dashboard and deploying to Heroku. It uses a Flask app to pull from a database and create charts based on a userâ€™s selection from a dropdown menu on the dashboard. This dataset (from [The Public Science Lab](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/)) explores the biodiversity inhabiting the human belly button.
